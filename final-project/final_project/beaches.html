        <h2>BEACH 92ND STREET, ROCKAWAY</h2>
        <p>Rockaway's main surfing beach is just blocks from the A train and perhaps New York's most crowded breaks. It's also one of the more dangerous and challenging waves-steep, fast, and often unpredictable. The congestion can make the natives (or those claiming to be natives) testy.

      <div class="beachcard">
        <img src="images/beach_rock2.jpg" width=100%>
        <h2>BEACH 67TH STREET, ROCKAWAY</h2>
        <p>Rockâ€™s other surfing beach is every bit as steep and erratic as the break at 92nd Street, though not nearly as crowded or hostile, making it a better spot for learning. Novice surfers should stay aware of the wooden pilings protruding from the shoreline before catching a wave.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="beachcard">
        <img src="images/beach_longbeach1.jpg" width=100%>
        <h2>LINCOLN BOULEVARD, LONG BEACH</h2>
        <p>Mellow and incredibly predictable, the break is excellent for beginners (and located just a few blocks from the LIRR station and Unsound surf shop, where you can rent a board). Best spot for a post-surf nosh: the Beach House on West Beech Street.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="beachcard">
        <img src="images/beach_longbeach2.jpg" width=100%>
        <h2>NATIONAL BOULEVARD, LONG BEACH</h2>
        <p>The consistent, user-friendly wave was one of the best-kept secrets of the Long Beach surf scene for years. Then came the posh Allegria Hotel, a National Boulevard surf cam (nysea.com), and the ongoing ASP World Tour event, all of which means its low-flying days are done.</p>
